<!-- Steps of the Project -->

1. Change the data of the excel file from the swetest
2. Change all the data of the Asteriods on the excel sheet.
<!-- Next Steps -->
3. Get the Speed
4. Calculate the Retrograde and Stationary phases according to it.
<!-- If the longitude speed is less than 0, then the planet is Rx. If it is zero, then the planet is stationary. If the speed > 0, then the planet is direct. I trust you have read the options information to know to add the "s" parameter in order to get the speed from "swetest".  -->
5. Check Where is it is -0 Then it is retrograde. [Done]
6. Stationary Phases to Complete for the Planets or which data we have.
7. Save the Word file and access it in API. [Done]
   <!-- Apply the file on all the Macros -->
   <!-- Get All the Code of the Macro and Write That on the List for the references -->
8. Apply the Code on each of the files.
9. Check One by One.
10. <!-- swetest -b11.07.1996 -ut14:34:1 -p -house74.55,32.4333333,P -fPZS -roundsec -->
    <!-- Logic for correct Data -->
    <!-- Get the data of  -->
11. Get the Min and Seconds.
12. Round of the Seconds.
13. Lose the Ones that are not equal to 5 and greater.
14. Choose the smallest value.
15. You will get a result.
<!-- BackLog -->
16. Use GeneralInforme for generating reports
17. When Genreating natal report replace Natal chart data and also the Sun Return Data and user birth date and date should be local.
18. When Generating Sun Return Replace Natal chart and also the Sun Return data with Start and finish date of Sun and Birth date and date should be in local.
19. When Generating Moon Return Replace Natal chart and also the Moon Return data with Start and finish date of Moon and Birth date and date should be in local.

20. Install the package
21. Free the space for build tools If not come up with the solution or wheel
<!-- BackLog -->
22. Connect API with Wordpress Frontend
23. Replace the file and code from the server.
24. Integerate the Payment of PayPal.
<!-- Fixing Previous Milestone -->
25. When Running the change_excel_general route then get the data of the Sun Return and moon return
