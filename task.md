<!-- Steps of the Project -->

1. Change the data of the excel file from the swetest
2. Change all the data of the Asteriods on the excel sheet.
<!-- Next Steps -->
3. Get the Speed
4. Calculate the Retrograde and Stationary phases according to it.
<!-- If the longitude speed is less than 0, then the planet is Rx. If it is zero, then the planet is stationary. If the speed > 0, then the planet is direct. I trust you have read the options information to know to add the "s" parameter in order to get the speed from "swetest".  -->
5. Check Where is it is -0 Then it is retrograde.
